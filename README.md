# Python Mini Projects

A collection of small Python practice projects and warm-up exercises.

## Projects

- [Simple Chatbot](simple_chatbot/) - A basic conversational chatbot with keyword-based responses
- [FastAPI Simple API](fastapi-simple-api/) - A minimal REST API built with FastAPI, showcasing basic endpoints and automatic OpenAPI docs

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

Each project should be in its own folder with:
- `README.md` - Project description and instructions
- `main.py` or `project_name.py` - Main code file
- Any additional files as needed
